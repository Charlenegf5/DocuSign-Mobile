# DocuSign Objective-C Client

**ORGANIZATION**

  * `/sdk`:  Source code for the client 
  * `/test`:  Unit tests and sample code

**HOW TO USE**

There are two main ways of using this client:  

  1. Create a podfile, run pod install, then use the `.xcworkspace` project file moving forward.
  2. Copy the source files directly into your existing projectâ€™s source directories and `import`.

For method #1 you can do the following:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods # This may require sudo
```

Then create a file called in your root project directory called `podfile` and add:
